              <p>"Not only does Amy take amazing pictures, she knows how to make the photo session fun. She helped my shy 5 year daughter feel completely comfortable during our session. She captured my daughters personality perfectly. Our session resulted in so many beautiful pictures that I will forever treasure."</p>

              <p>"Amy took my daughter's senior pictures last year and I was more than pleased with them. They literally took my breath away. I already knew how talented she was as a photographer, but when I saw the photos I was emotional in the best way possible. Everything from the perfect ray of warm sunlight framing her face, to drawing out Allie's true essence was captured exquisitely. Amy puts her heart and soul into each and every picture and gives it the attention and patience she would if photographing her own family. Her dedication to make your pictures unique and beautiful will have you treasuring each genuine moment she brings to life on film. Last but certainly not least, she pours over your future memories and perfects them so that when you receive the finished product you will be extremely happy you made the right choice. I know I am!"</p>
